These repositories contain the source code for the operating system which I started writing at age 16 after having learnt programming in Assembly Language, C, C++ and hardware basics just out of inquisitiveness to learn the working of the computer in as detailed a way as possible. I have always been fascinated by the power of computers to do a billion calculations per second, methodically do all the tasks told to it and function just as programmed.The way it manages its resources so skillfully and with infallible acuracy and speed really made me determined to penetrate the deepest secrets of the machine hidden from our eyes by the colourful GUI. I thought ,"What better way than to start writing an Operating System ???".And I got started. My OS is not yet complete and is currently under development. However, should you wish to see, download or use the code written by me in any of your own works, please feel free to do so.
