These repositories contain the source code for the operating system which I started writing just out of inquisitiveness to learn the working of the computer in as detailed a way as possible. I was initially only a budding programmer but the power of operating systems to manage the resources of the computer so skilfully and with a great amount of control over everything really fascinated me and I thought of writing my own OS only to learn the deepest of the secrets hidden from our eyes by the Graphical Interface. My OS is not yet complete and is currently under development. However, should you wish to see, download or use the code written by me in any of your own works, please feel free to do so.
